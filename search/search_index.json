We measure economic and sustainability metrics as proxies for how they will impact the lives of our selves, peers, and future generations. Movements like recycling, fair trade, and carbon neutrality can all be traced back to the preservation of our species. Yet these proxies often distract us from the actual purpose. For example, in the 1960's Nobel Prize winner Norman Borlaug developed \"The Green Revolution\" to greatly improve farming by utilizing a system of high yielding variety crops, monoculture practices, crop rotation, pesticide, new irrigation practices, and fossil fuel based fertilizer. This system displaced existing farmers and methods as the seed costs where higher, more mechanization was utilises, and more energy, water, and financial inputs were required. In the 1980's however productivity began to stall and backslide [ Consequence of Green Revolution in Asia ]. The hidden cost of industrial farming resulted in the depletion of topsoil, water pollution, low nutrient food, and loss of mid-sized farms, finally damaging downstream economies. This was later associated with the global obesity epidemic due to fewer crop varieties and lower nutrient soil [ Syndemic ]. This is but one of many examples of good intentioned systems being developed and implemented without considering the long-term, complex, and multi-objective impact. In response, more homogeneous metrics include sustainability. For example the United Nations 2030 Agenda development goals balances economic, social, and environmental sustainability, later echoed by the African Union's 2063 Agenda . These frameworks emphasize a balance between economic, social, and environmental sustainability, recognizing that success should not be measured solely in terms of economic growth but should also consider the broader impact on society and the environment.
